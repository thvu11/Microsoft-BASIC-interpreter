# Microsoft-BASIC-interpreter

## Project description

In this project, our team attempts to create a mobile application that helps primary school students to learn how to program in Microsoft Basic. Our objective is to implement basic syntax and allow students to input simple statement without being worried about correct syntax. After that, the application will try to implement some fundamental programming concepts such as logical statement, looping and some basic data structures. The application must be able to respond and recover from logical error in an acceptable time.
